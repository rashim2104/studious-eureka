**Title: The Forgotten Kingdom**

Once upon a time, in a land shrouded in mist and mystery, there existed a kingdom forgotten by time. Its name was whispered only in legends, and its existence was known to very few. Deep within the dense forests and towering mountains, lies the hidden realm of Eldoria.

Eldoria was a place of magic and wonder, where ancient powers flowed through the earth and the air hummed with enchantment. The kingdom was ruled by a line of wise and just kings and queens, who wielded the power of the elements to protect their land and people.

At the heart of Eldoria stood the great Crystal Palace, a structure of shimmering crystal that reflected the colors of the rainbow. Within its walls, the royal family kept watch over the kingdom, safeguarding its secrets from those who would seek to do harm.

But despite their best efforts, darkness began to stir in the shadows of Eldoria. Whispers of an ancient evil spread through the land, and strange creatures roamed the forests, threatening the safety of the kingdom.

It was in this time of turmoil that a young orphan named Elysia discovered her true heritage. Raised by the village elders, Elysia had always felt a connection to the magic of Eldoria, but she never imagined the role she would play in its fate.

As Elysia delves deeper into her past, she uncovers dark secrets that have long been buried. With the help of unlikely allies, including a mischievous fairy and a brooding warrior, Elysia sets out on a quest to save Eldoria from destruction.

But the path ahead is fraught with danger, and Elysia soon realizes that her journey will test not only her strength and courage but also her heart. For in the heart of darkness lies the key to unlocking the kingdom's true power, and only Elysia can unleash the magic that will save Eldoria from oblivion.

ROMANCE CONTEMPORARY HAPPY

Thursday, Jan 18 2:12 PM

To: eliserhodes@elliott.edu

From: fredericklaird@greerstate.edu

SUBJECT: Your (Brilliant) Paper on Mirrors/Jane Eyre

Dear Professor Rhodes,

I hope this email finds you well. I must confess that, although we have never met, I am a longtime admirer of your work‚ÄîI was actually at your talk on Charlotte Bront√´ and Elizabeth Gaskell last year, which I greatly enjoyed.

I write to you today to express my sincerest compliments on your paper The Beast Within: Mirrors and the Internalized Male Gaze in Jane Eyre. I know better than anyone how difficult it is to find something new to say about such a beloved piece of literature, but you managed it exquisitely here. You have me rethinking a book I thought I knew better than anyone else living.

I‚Äôm currently teaching an upper level seminar on feminism in gothic literature, and I had my students read your paper in conjunction with good old Jane, so I thought it was only right that I reach out and let you know how much fruitful discussion it has engendered. And‚Äîseeing as you‚Äôre clearly an expert on the subject‚Äîwould you happen to have any suggestions for my little seminar? It‚Äôs my first time teaching the course, so any guidance would be much appreciated.

Warmest Regards,

Frederick Laird

Associate Professor of English Language Arts, Greer State University

RE: Your (Brilliant) Paper on Mirrors/Jane Eyre

Dear Professor Laird,

First, my heartfelt thanks for your kind email. I‚Äôm sure you know as well as I that toiling away in the humanities often feels like shouting into a void. These papers that fill our waking hours are no small things, and yet we send them out into the ether, to be read by ten people if we‚Äôre lucky. So your generous compliments have made my week, and I would be delighted to help a fellow Jane enthusiast in any way I can.

Would you believe me if I said I‚Äôve long been a fan of yours, too? I actually just referred a particularly enterprising student to your (thrilling and evocative!) paper I Eat Men like Air: Du Maurier‚Äôs Rebecca as a Plathian Heroine earlier this week. One of life‚Äôs funny coincidences. If you choose to believe in those, that is‚Äîa la Mary Shelley, I do not.

Anyways, on to your seminar. It sounds fascinating! I wish my college would release me from English 101 and Writing for Accountants purgatory and let me teach courses like that. If you‚Äôre teaching Jane, then I assume you‚Äôre also doing Rebecca, especially considering your own research. Might I recommend a recent Bluebeard retelling, one that‚Äôs more on the nose‚ÄîAnna Biller‚Äôs divisive but worthy Bluebeard‚Äôs Castle? It might be a welcome reprieve from all those buttoned-up Brits if you‚Äôre up for it!

Finally, a question (or two!) for you, which you need not answer if they offend you. Do you find it strange to teach a feminist literature seminar as a man? Do you think your gender gives you a unique perspective, or do you find it a hindrance?

Please let me know if I can provide any further assistance; I so rarely get to discuss such interesting fare!

Yours in Scholarship,

Elise Rhodes

Assistant Professor of English Literature, Elliott College

RE: RE: Your Brilliant Paper on Mirrors/Jane Eyre 

Professor Rhodes,

Many thanks for your quick, thoughtful response. And I‚Äôm so flattered that you enjoyed my paper‚ÄîI agree that validation is sadly rare in our chosen profession, and your kind words mean the world to me. 

I was unfamiliar with the book you suggested, but I‚Äôve just acquired a copy/done a cursory read and it looks to be a perfect fit for the class. Certainly controversial, but I think my students will enjoy a spirited debate. There is a dearth of modern gothic literature, and I‚Äôm so grateful to you for your excellent recommendation.

To answer your questions, which did not offend me in the least: yes, I do find it to be a little strange. I‚Äôm the only professor in my department with this particular expertise, but I still wonder if I‚Äôm right for the class. However, while I would never go so far as to say that a man could have a better perspective on feminism than a woman, I am not much hindered. The books do the work themselves, really.

Thank you again, and I will keep you apprised of how the seminar goes, if that‚Äôs agreeable to you.

Regards,

Frederick Laird

P.S.: You truly don‚Äôt believe in coincidence? Mary Shelley notwithstanding, I believe you‚Äôre in the literary minority on that. I leave you with Tolstoy: ‚ÄúAll this is only the coincidence of conditions under which every organic, elemental event of life is accomplished.‚Äù

RE: RE: RE: Your Brilliant Paper on Mirrors/Jane Eyre

Professor Laird,

To be honest, I‚Äôm relieved you didn‚Äôt try to claim some unique male perspective on feminist literature‚Äîit would have disappointed me to end such an interesting conversation. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should be flattered or concerned that you took my recommendation so quickly. Looks like I‚Äôm not alone in having no personal life to speak of!

And, as I‚Äôve said, you need not thank me. Please, keep me posted!

Best,

Elise (if we are to continue these emails, I must insist on first names!)

P.S.: It almost seems like cheating to punctuate your point with Tolstoy‚Äîthe man was so wordy that he has a pull-quote for just about anything! I leave you with Albert Einstein, who I would argue knew more about so-called coincidence than any author: ‚ÄúCoincidence is God‚Äôs way of remaining anonymous.‚Äù

Apologies again!

SUBJECT: Fred‚Äôs Lack of a Personal Life

Elise,

No apologies needed. Your joke was both appropriate and spot-on. I‚Äîlike you?‚Äîam ‚Äúmarried to the job,‚Äù which is especially pathetic considering how low my salary is even after twelve years. And here I‚Äôd been told academia was where the money was.

Anyways, I had a thought about my seminar. What about Northanger Abbey? A gothic satire could be a fun addition, and I‚Äôd love to include Jane Austen. Even if this was admittedly far from her best.

Let me know what you think.

Fred

P.S.: I hope you don‚Äôt mind that I started a new chain. Scrolling through the old one was exacerbating my eyestrain.

P.P.S.: I‚Äôm out of quotes, so agree to disagree on coincidence.

P.P.P.S: Do you have anything interesting going on? This conversation is feeling far too me-centric.

RE: Fred‚Äôs Lack of a Personal Life

Fred,

That‚Äôs a relief! And, yes, I suppose I‚Äôm in the same sort of marriage (though mine is only eleven-years strong)‚Äîif only it weren‚Äôt so one-sided. I think my department forgets I exist half the time.

I think Northanger is a wonderful idea! You said you needed guidance, but your instincts are faultless as far as I can tell. I love the Bront√´s, but I agree that a light satire to break through all that gloom would be welcome. Though you‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs far from Jane‚Äôs best‚Äîthat would have to be Persuasion for me, Pride and Prejudice be damned.

Enjoy the weekend!

Elise

P.S.: ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù and ‚Äúme‚Äù don‚Äôt often overlap. Unless you consider grading a mountain of Freshman essays (most of which will inevitably be written by ChatGPT) to be interesting? I am driving up to my sister‚Äôs this weekend, though. And I promised I‚Äôd leave my laptop at home for once, so I‚Äôll probably be out of reach until Monday.

RE: RE: Fred‚Äôs Lack of a Personal Life

Elise,

I‚Äôm sorry, and very surprised, to hear about your professional dissatisfaction. If someone of your caliber feels forgotten, I can only assume that your department is woefully mismanaged.

And I should have guessed you would be the one to agree with me on Persuasion. My colleagues have accused me of being contrarian just for the sake of it, but I‚Äôve always found it to be Jane‚Äôs most romantic work. There‚Äôs a pervasive melancholy to it that reflects a total departure from something like Emma, and I (perhaps selfishly) love the idea that more realistic characters who are past their youthful prime can still find perfect happiness. That it was Jane‚Äôs final novel makes me mourn her early demise all the more‚Äîwho knows where she would have gone next?

I hope you have a safe trip and a relaxing weekend.

Fred

P.S.: It seems coincidence is not the only thing we disagree on. From our limited correspondence, I can already tell that a Venn Diagram of ‚ÄúElise‚Äù and ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù would be a circle.

Fred,

Ok i couldn‚Äôt figure out how to reply on the old thread. I guess I lied about being out of touch all weekend. My sister basically forced a bottle of wine down my throat then wetn to sleep. Is 2 days of emails enough for me to be telling you this?? Going with yes

You‚Äôre so nice to say all that. I think I kind of needed to hear it actually. Its been a while since i‚Äôve felt seen by anyone and somehow you;ve done it over email. And yes yes yes about persuasion!!!! Wentworth‚Äôs letter at the end is the most romantic thing i‚Äôve ever read. Half agony, half hope!! And i think about what jane would have done next every day. You get it

Do you agree that emails are kind of like letters??

Elies

PS: My sister looked you up on facebook and we know everything you;ve done since 2008. I can‚Äôt believe you were in marching band?? You should probably private that before your students find it.  

PPS: i think you‚Äôre interesting too

RE: Elise after a bottle of wine

Elies,

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having fun with your sister, even if she did liquor you up then leave you to fend for yourself. And I‚Äôd say 2 days of emails is plenty. It‚Äôs not like I have anything better to do on a Sunday morning, considering my well-established lack of a personal life. Which you apparently know far too much about now‚ÄîI think I‚Äôll skip private-ing and just delete my Facebook entirely. I shudder to think of someone (else) important finding evidence of my frosted tips phase. 

It hardly seems fair that I don‚Äôt know anything embarrassing about you, although I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd argue that your last email suffices. We‚Äôll call it even for now; I suspect your embarrassment when you wake up will be even worse than the hangover (not that I think it should be, to be clear.)

Yes, of course Wentworth‚Äôs letter is the best part. I agree that emails are a sort of modern equivalent to letters, and I think that the well-known ease of texting makes choosing to send emails all the more romantic. 

I hope you don‚Äôt feel too bad when you wake up.

Fred

P.S.: I won‚Äôt lie and say it‚Äôs pleasant, but I recommend a shot of pickle juice for the hangover. Believe it or not, the marching band drank as much as any fraternity.

RE: RE: Elise after a bottle of wine

Elise,

I just realized that I used the word ‚Äúromantic‚Äù without clarifying which of its multiple definitions I intended. I meant ‚Äúromantic‚Äù in the sense of an idealized, aestheticized view of the past, nothing more. I hope you didn‚Äôt think I misunderstood the tone of your last email, and I apologize for any offense.

Elise,

I fear that my correction has created a much bigger problem, and I ask that we strike it from the proverbial record. I leave my original response up to your interpretation, and you may read into every word whichever definition is most amenable to you. It also felt appropriate to start a new thread, for both of our sakes. Though I reiterate that you have no reason to feel embarrassed‚Äîthat (dis)honor is all mine, I‚Äôm afraid.

Have a safe trip home.

Fred

RE: Fred and Elise‚Äôs Fresh Start

Fred,

I‚Äôm sorry for being MIA. I hope you didn‚Äôt think I was offended by anything you said! It was just my own embarrassment, and I didn‚Äôt see any of your responses until now (and now that I have, you have nothing at all to be embarrassed about?). Honestly, I‚Äôve been avoiding my email since I woke up on Sunday. Which has been especially difficult because this is my work email! I needn‚Äôt have worried, though. Of course you would be so nice about it. Still, I promise that‚Äôs the last drunk email you‚Äôll be receiving from me‚ÄîI‚Äôm swearing off alcohol for the foreseeable future!

Anyways, yes, I like the idea that there‚Äôs something romantic about emailing over texting. Actually, emails are almost a perfect marriage of the past with the present‚Äîwe acknowledge that technology has facilitated ease of communication without completely doing away with the formalities and idiosyncrasies that gave letters character. 

While it might be easier for us to exchange numbers if we plan to keep this conversation up, I suggest we don‚Äôt, at least for now.

How‚Äôs your week going? Any updates on the seminar?

Elise

P.S.: Thank you for giving me interpretation rights on ‚Äúromantic;‚Äù that was very generous of you. I‚Äôve always been of the camp that you should assume the most popular definition unless the author indicates otherwise. And if the author indicates otherwise, but immediately "strikes that from the record", then I guess that puts us back at the most popular definition of "romantic." Which is perfectly fine by me. Unless you‚Äôd like to issue another correction?

P.P.S: Call me crazy, but I didn‚Äôt think the frosted tips looked that bad.

SUBJECT: Fred‚Äôs Proposition

Elise,

I admit I‚Äôm relieved that the late response had nothing to do with me. And I love your idea about emails bridging the gap between the past and the present. That actually sounds like an interesting paper, if you‚Äôre looking to try something new. And, yes, let‚Äôs keep the emails going.

Speaking of my seminar, I just had a thought: would you be interested in coming in to do a guest lecture? Funnily enough, we‚Äôre actually talking about letters in a few weeks. Nothing so romantic as Wentworth‚Äôs letter to Anne, sadly‚Äîwe‚Äôll mainly be discussing marriage as an instrument to subjugate women through Isabella‚Äôs letter from Ch. 13 of Wuthering Heights. A bit dark for right before Valentine‚Äôs Day, I‚Äôm aware. Still, I know you‚Äôve written on this issue before, and we would love to get your expert perspective.

The class is Wednesday, February 13 from 5:00 to 7:00 P.M. I know you have your own classes, and that we‚Äôre about an hour‚Äôs drive from you, but please let me know if you‚Äôre interested.

To quote a more eloquent Frederick than I: I am half agony, half hope as I await your reply.

Fred

P.S.: No corrections here.

P.P.S.: If you are able to come, does ‚Äúswearing off alcohol‚Äù mean I can‚Äôt persuade you to have a drink with me after class?

I would be thrilled to do a guest lecture, especially on such an interesting topic!! I only teach in the morning on Wednesdays, so that should work. We can figure out logistics closer to the date, but I‚Äôm excited about this! And of course it will be nice to finally meet in person.

Elise

P.S.: I see how you could read ‚Äúswearing off alcohol‚Äù that way but I, the author, am indicating otherwise ;)

This story is a charming portrayal of intellectual camaraderie and friendship. Through dialogue and relatable characters, it explores themes of validation, loneliness, and the search for connection in academia. With its engaging and thoughtful exploration of literary passion, it resonated with me as reader and a teacher, albeit elementary and not collegiate, who appreciates meaningful conversation and the power of human connection.

You deserve the win! I really mindblown by how you effectively create the scene and story without even a single world of narration and just relying solely on emails. And what fascinates me more in your writing is the way you portrays the character personality. No much description needed and we could almost imagine the sparkling chemistry between two intellectual individuals.

The shared love of literature between the two characters makes me like them all the more. (My controversial Austen opinion might upset them though: I think the 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie is better than the book.)

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot.

Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-
'Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly ...

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-
'Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly ...

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car.

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car.

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car.

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car.

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car.

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

COMING OF AGE GAY ROMANCE

This story contains sensitive content

Trigger warning: Contains underage sexual content, mentions of assault

You know the movie Dirty Dancing? The one where Baby goes off to that fancy resort with her parents for the summer, and in the beginning she is a good, sweet girl who loves her daddy, and then by the end she is still a good sweet girl who loves her daddy but now she is kinda sexy too and can dance like a pro and is totally in love with that beautiful dance teacher. Why doesn‚Äôt anyone talk about how that teacher is clearly much, much older than Baby, and despite Patrick Swayze‚Äôs swoon-worthy body and to-die-for dance moves, it is probably borderline illegal for him to end up with her? And then I think, well of course no one talks about that because all of us growing up wanted to be Baby, we wanted Johnny‚Äôs fingertips to caress our waist and make us giggle, we wanted to learn how to do lifts in the lake, we wanted to wake up in a dirty shack in the woods after losing our virginity to the bad boy dance teacher with the beautiful abs. 

I blame Dirty Dancing for thousands of young teen girls summer flings, for all the girls who became camp counselors in the hopes of meeting their own Johnny Castles, only to realize that a sleep-away camp job was more about bug spray and bandaids than romance. Also, all the male dance instructors I ever met were gay. 

But the lure of Baby in her tiny shorts was like a right of passage, every teen and pre-teen girl‚Äôs invitation to a wild (and somewhat inappropriate) summer romance.

Most of them were nothing like Dirty Dancing of course. Most of them involved the back seats of old cars or sticky kisses behind the bleachers at the high school. If the girl was lucky it was at least exciting, if she was even luckier, consensual. There was often music, however, a song playing on the radio that when you heard it twenty years later it would remind you of the smell of old leather, the taste of strawberry Chapstick.

For me, it all happened the summer I was 14. His name was Morgan , he was 17, and he was no Johnny Castle. Also, it wasn‚Äôt consensual, not really, although I didn‚Äôt exactly say no either. Also, I liked girls at the time, but I can‚Äôt really blame him for not knowing that. It was the 90‚Äôs, things were starting to change, but it was still not really ok to be out and proud like it is now. 

It was exciting though. Not the kissing part, which was wet and messy and too fast, or the sex, which was the same. 

No, the exciting part was what happened after.

I wasn‚Äôt in love with Morgan. I wasn‚Äôt even in like with him, but I was 14 and bored. Nothing happened in the summer in the tiny town where I lived. Nothing happened during the school year either, but at least there were football games and afterschool clubs and stuff. In the summer, the older kids who had licenses would drive an hour away to the shore and drink beers in the sun all day. Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Morgan had a license, but he also had a job bagging groceries at the local supermarket four days a week, which meant less time for suntanning and more time to seduce underage girls in the Foodtown parking lot. 

The person I really liked in the summer of 1992, right before my sophomore year of high school, was Stacy; soon to be senior, 16 years old, with long curly auburn hair and big brown eyes. Stacy was the reason I ended up in the parking lot that night to begin with, she was the reason I was dressed in my shortest shorts and the bright blue bikini top that I basically lived in that July. 

She was also the reason my sophomore year of high school went the way it did. Let‚Äôs just say that when you are 14 and hopelessly in love and someone takes advantage of your innocence you go a little crazy.

Not Morgan. I barely remember him.

But I will remember that first kiss with Stacy forever.

Morgan had a beat up Toyota Camry that he had inherited from some family member, and he had tossed two fuzzy checkered blankets into the backseat. My 14 year old self did not think twice about this; it wasn‚Äôt until I was much older that it occurred to me about the kind of boy who would keep two folded up blankets in the backseat of his car. He kissed me and I played along (it wasn‚Äôt actually my first kiss) and then he put his hand underneath my bikini top and I went along with that too. By the time he was unbuttoning my jean shorts, his eyebrows raised questioningly, (he did ask first, in his own way) I had already gone along with so many things I figured what was the point in saying no now. Like I said, it was summer in a small NJ town, I was bored to death, and Morgan was something new. 

Stacy appeared a few minutes after it was over, her long tan legs sauntering across that Foodtown parking lot like a supermodel on the runway. She walked right up to the Camry and opened the door. 

‚ÄúMorgan, really??! She‚Äôs barely a sophomore!‚Äù Stacy then turned her dark brown eyes to me. 

‚ÄúGia? You are Gia right?‚Äù I nodded.

‚ÄúAre you ok? Did he hurt you?‚Äù

I considered this for a moment. 

‚ÄúNo, not really.‚Äù

Stacy watched as I awkwardly retied my bikini top. The expression on her face was unreadable. When I was fully dressed again she offered me her hand.

‚ÄúCome on Gia,‚Äù she said. 

Morgan was refolding the blankets but he had the decency to at least look up long enough to say goodbye. He didn‚Äôt offer to call me or anything; that wasn‚Äôt part of this whole experience. But he did smile and say ‚ÄúSee you around.‚Äù

Stacy and I walked out of the parking lot and down Main Street.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of a douche,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I get it, an older guy with a car and all.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain that no, Morgan‚Äôs car had nothing to do with it, that I really just had nothing else to do that afternoon. But that made me sound like a whore and I wanted Stacy to like me, so I just shrugged.

We kept walking, all the way to the Wawa on the end of Main. Stacy then proclaimed it was ‚Äúhot as balls‚Äù outside and she wanted a frozen lemonade. One drink, two straws (like the country song).

We drank it right there outside the Wawa, and when she kissed me afterwards, her lips tasted like lemons.

‚ÄúAm I right though?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúYou like girls? I‚Äôm usually right.‚Äù

I nodded, slightly breathless, eyes wide.

Stacy smiled. ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm usually right‚Äù, she repeated. And then, even though I hadn‚Äôt asked. ‚ÄúI like everyone.‚Äù

Years later, sitting on a twin bed at Smith College, I told this story to my roommate. Ayala was from Queens; street smart and very beautiful, and she had rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúThey are the absolute worst.‚Äù I assumed she meant guys like Morgan but she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo silly. There is a Morgan on every street corner. I mean girls like Stacy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt tell Ayala the rest of the story. That I had spent all of July and half of August floating through town like a tumbleweed. Each time, just when I thought it was over, Stacy would suddenly appear and we would spend the afternoon together, drinking frozen lemonade, swinging on the old tire swing in the middle school playground. One day we went to the town pool, another we rode bikes down to the muddy lake and tossed pebbles into the water. Anyone looking at us from the outside would have just assumed we were good friends, slowly inching our way through the long summer days. They didn‚Äôt see what we did when no one was looking. Stacy left for a family vacation in mid-August, but before she did she kissed me long and hard and told me that I was the prettiest girl she had ever been with.

In the fall she started dating the captain of the football team, a pairing that I found cliche and unsatisfying. I did not handle it well; Morgan‚Äôs Camry was not the last backseat I found myself in, and his were not the only fuzzy blankets. By the time Stacy and her jock boyfriend won prom king and queen that spring (she wore a long blue dress with sequins and a slit up the side) I had developed somewhat of a reputation.

Stacy graduated and went off to some college upstate. I spent the summer before my junior year working at a sleep away camp on the shore where I actually met a cute dance instructor. (Her name was Hannah, not Johnny.) Hannah was a sweet girl with blond hair and dimples that burrowed into her cheeks when she laughed, and we had three weeks of innocent and completely consensual fun. On the last day of camp she got a little teary and told me that I was the first girl she had ever been with. I lied and told her the same.

After college I followed the well worn path of many a New Jersey girl and moved to a tiny one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate I met on Craigslist. When she decided three years later that she couldn‚Äôt hack NYC life and moved out, I decided to keep the apartment for myself.

The girls I met on dating apps liked to talk nostalgically about their past, about high school when your biggest concern was Friday‚Äôs midterm and what to wear to school in the morning. About college when you could drink 6 beers, pass out in someone‚Äôs dorm room, and stumble into sociology the next morning in your pajamas and no one batted an eyelash. They whined about the unfair expectations of the current job market, about high maintenance women with unrealistic dating goals. When they asked me about my past I would always reply with ‚ÄúSmall town Jersey‚Äù, as if that explained everything. Maybe it did.

All I knew is I was happy to be grown, happy to no longer be a lost teenager desperate for any kind of adventure. You couldn‚Äôt pay me enough to be 14 again.

Morgan actually became somewhat of a low key celebrity, known for a popular series of YouTube videos about woodworking, or sculpting or something maker-ish like that. The last video I saw had over one million views.

Stacy married a stockbroker and last I checked she was living in a big white house in the suburbs with 2 kids under 2 and a big, fluffy golden retriever. I have no idea if that was the life she wanted. Sometimes, late at night when I can‚Äôt sleep, I like to think that it wasn‚Äôt; that somewhere deep in the back of her mind she still thinks of me as the one who got away.

Its a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away, like the entrance to a long tunnel you are driving through, until it is barely a dot in your memory. But occasionally something attaches itself, stubborn and prickly like a barnacle in the ocean, and it can take you years to shake it off.

On the last night of my honeymoon in Cancun, I was sipping a glass of champagne by the water when my beautiful new wife turned to me and said, ‚ÄúTell me your deepest darkest secret.‚Äù

I thought for a moment, the gentle soundtrack of the waves playing in the background. There were plenty of things I could tell her, plenty of embarrassing moments from a younger life that had not been particularly reserved or conservative. But instead I shook my hair out of my face and said, ‚ÄúIt took me twenty years to finally know what kind of person I want to be.‚Äù

Cynthia raised her eyebrows, clearly having expected something different. 

‚ÄúAnd what kind is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone worthy of love‚Äù, I replied. 

She kissed me then, and it wasn‚Äôt at all like being 14 in the backseat of a Camry or like the taste of lemonade in the parking lot of the Wawa. It wasn‚Äôt like deep in the forest at Camp Mohunk, the scent of bug spray in everyone‚Äôs hair. It wasn‚Äôt like dorm rooms in college or the wet spongey air in the back of that bar in Red Hook. It wasn‚Äôt like any of those times.

This time, this kiss, was like coming home.

Good job and your win is well deserved. I was totally engrossed in how you dealt with your sexual maturity during your teen-age years. Your story totally resonated with me. I, being a shy boy and scared of girls found comfort with manatees at the beach.

Also, the Dirty Dancing reference!

Great job!

Oh wonderful story, my favorite this week!
A woman who in looking for connections, found all the wrong people first, but fortunately made it through in one piece.

I loved the connection to Dirty Dancing, it called to mind a particular era, and a particular world.

I really liked these lines, they describe the grip of certain memories-

Great story, Jennifer, I enjoyed reading what seemed like a true, no BS, memoir of your early years.
Only one criticism: ‚ÄúIts a funny thing, your past. Mostly it shrinks father and father away‚Ä¶..‚Äù should read ‚Äúfarther and farther away‚Äù!

Your story drew me in on so many levels not the least of which was a different perspective on Dirty Dancing. Your descriptions, details and dialogue made me feel like I was living right alongside Gia. I also loved the tunnel metaphor. I really enjoyed reading this. Nice work.

C Introduction
What is C?
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.

C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

Why Learn C?
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies
Difference between C and C++
C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax
The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not
Get Started
This tutorial will teach you the basics of C.

It is not necessary to have any prior programming experience.

C Output (Print Text)
Output (Print Text)
To output values or print text in C, you can use the printf() function:

Example
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}
Double Quotes
When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".

If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:

Example
printf("This sentence will work!");
printf(This sentence will produce an error.);
Many printf Functions
You can use as many printf() functions as you want. However, note that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

Example
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  printf("And it is awesome!");
  return 0;
}
